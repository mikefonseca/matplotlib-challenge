Three observable trends based on the data:

1. Capomulin and Ramicane were able to reduce tumors in a 45 day time period by ~19%, while the other drugs (Infubinol, Ketapril) were all close to placebo, or worse, in efficacy.  This means that we would want to invest more heavily in Capomulin and Ramicane production and discontinue Infubinol and Ketapril.

2. Spread was equally slower with Capomulin and Ramicane, also indicating this isthe best drug to use, along with Ramicane.

3. Survival rates were best with Capomulin and Ramicane, indicating further investment in this drug.
